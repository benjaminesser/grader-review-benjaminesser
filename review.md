Zichen/Abdirahman
We like the simplicity of the code
Zichen: It skips the unnecessary steps that involve making directories or changing them, which will reduce the risk of compilation error when editing $CPATH, or getting confused by the directories.
Abdirahman: I didn’t understand what line 18 of Ben’s code. Now i understand that his if statement is checking if his files compile and have no errors
His code seems to work on everything
We learned what grep -q does
No suggestions here, he did great
